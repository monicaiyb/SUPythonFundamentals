- Create a program that calculates any number, in otherwords create a calculator in python.

## Extra Challenge

Write a program that, given a price in shillings  (i.e., 1000 shillings), determines the method of giving change that uses the fewest coins. The program will not take input from the user, but rather it will begin with a hard-coded value for the price, i.e.:

price = 6700
The result of the program should be given in the format below: 100 shilling first, then 200 shilling, 500 shilling, 1000 shillings each on a separate line:

Here’s an example of the output, given an intial price of 6700 shillings:

The price of your item is 6700 shillings, and your change is 3300 shillings.
Here's the change that uses the fewest coins:

    1000 shillings: 3
    500 shillings: 0
    200 shillings: 1
    100 shillings: 1
Note: this program can be done with only the arithmetic operators: + - // * %. In addition, you must create variables (coin100, coin200, coin500, and coin1000) to hold the values you have caculated.

You may include any additional variables you choose.
